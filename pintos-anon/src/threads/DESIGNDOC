			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

thread.h: 
	int priority;                        /* Current Priority. */
    struct lock *priority_lock_master;   /* Pair Lock to this priority; NULL if it is default */
    /* Priority donated by other threads;
      we also save the donation's belonging lock */
    int stored_priority[30];
    struct lock *stored_lock_master[30];
    int stored_index;

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

Whenever H thread donate to L, we set L's priority to H and save previous to
stored_priority[] and save this donation's lock in pairs. 
Thus, every priority is bound with a lock(initial priority's lock is NULL).

Once a lock is released, we delete all the priorities got from this lock, 
and find the right front one in the remaining. Since the right most priority
pair is ensured to be highest, the algorithm is quite efficient.

Nested case:
|---| wait L1 		|---|	wait L2     |---|
|-H-|   -->			|-M-|    -->        |-L-|
|---|  				|-1-|				|-2-|

Here, L holds Lock2 and M holds Lock1, M donate L a priority and blocked;
L recive it and pair this priority with L2 (M,L2);
Now, H wants L1, H donate M, M pair it with L1 (H,L1), M get unblocked,
Then M checked if L2 is released, if not, donate current priority to holder,
L then recive and pair (H,L2). 
H,M is blocked, and H,M,L's priorities are all High.

L release L2, unblock M, and give up pair (H,L2),(M,L2), switch to stored 
(L,NULL). Now M is (H,L1) higher than L (M,L2), L yields immediately and M runs.
M release L1, wake up H, give up (H,L1), switech to (M,NULL), yields.
In this way, we solve this problem neatly.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

We use list_insert_ordered to ensure a priority queue to sema/lock/cond
waiter list. Every thread's priority is sure to be the highest in any
condition, so that waking up the front of the list meets the requirement.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

Check if lock has a holder. If not, gets the lock. Otherwise, loop:
	If current priority is higher than lock holder, donate it,
	Add to lock wait list, Block
Once nested donation happens, the loop keeps thread donating to lock
holder to make sure holder always get the proper priority to run in priority
scheduling.
So the nested donation is handled by recursive donation to lower thread.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

Remove all the priorities got from this lock, Switch to the highest in
remaining(which is right most one in stored_priority[]).Sema up(which 
wakes up the highest priority waiter).

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

L is running thread_set_priority, and setting a new priority; before
finshing it, H kicks in and donate H to L for whatever locks and H blocked;
L is now High Priority but it continues priority set which results in 
H's donation is lost.

My implementation's thread priority is always the highest. It could be
original or donated. when setting new priority:
1. If current priority gets from donation, original is stored in index 0
	we change the priority stored in stored_priority[0]
2. If current is original, we change it

A lock does not help because lock itself requires threads have proper priority,
and the problem could also happens to this function's temporary lock.

I avoid it by disabling interrupt inside this function.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

The implementation is very neat and clear that we don't need to change
the property 'priority' which saves a lot works to coordinate the original
code. The assumption made that priority is always the highest is useful
in scheduling. And the pair (Priority,Lock) is quite elegant that we do
not care about 'which thread is waiting for which lock I am holding'.

Other design like implementing a link list when donation happens requires
a lot editing on original codes and wastes space. The superior is the 
abstraction that we pair the donation and its lock to make sure a thread
with a lock waiting by others could always get a enough priority to release
it and maintain it an array to make sure multiple donation is working.
Array is quite simple to manipulate, right?

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

36		20  12  4   58  58  58      C

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

Yes. Timer ticks 8,16,24,36 we have multiple highest priority threads
in the ready list. The scheduler does not have any specification in 
choosing multiple highest priority threads, so I use "First Come 
First Serve". A thread is to run if it comes with that priority first
in the ready list.

Yes.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

A complex scheduling interrupt context will consume more time which 
can not be  interrupted. This will reduce the concurrency and 
performance so that I put code inside as less as I could, and keep it 
functioning in the meantime.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> disadvantages in your design choices.  If you were to have extra
>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?

The design consumes no extra space considering no advanced scheduler.
And the code is simple to keep balance its functioning and performance
inside a interrupt context.

However, there are disadvantages in updating priorities. When recent_cpu
is only changed in recent running threads, our algorithm calculates every
threads inside ready list every four ticks can be a huge waste in scheduler
when we have many threads in ready list.

We could save the running threads in the last four ticks and only
update their priorities to boost performance.
